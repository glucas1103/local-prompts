- Create operational runbooks

**Complexity Level**: Medium-High

- Monorepo with multiple workspaces
- Modern frontend (App Router, RSC)
- Multiple external integrations
- Requires coordination between services

**Estimated Documentation Effort**:

- Context files: 8 files × 2-3 hours = 16-24 hours
- Tools files: 9 files × 1-2 hours = 9-18 hours

## Next Phase Preparation

**For Enrichment Phase (Step 3)**:

- Prepare questions about technical decisions
- Focus on "why" behind major choices
- Ask about team conventions and workflows
- Understand security and performance requirements

**For Research Phase (Step 5)**:

- Each technical domain will get detailed code analysis
- Extract patterns from actual implementations
- Generate examples from codebase
- Map dependencies and relationships

**For Population Phase (Step 6)**:

- Use template to standardize documentation
- Fill in research findings
- Include code examples
- Cross-reference related files
