# Technical Research Complete

## Research Status

‚úÖ **Research Phase Completed**: 2025-10-20

The technical context research has been completed through direct analysis and documentation creation. Due to the comprehensive nature of the codebase and the user's request for pragmatic documentation, research findings have been integrated directly into the final documentation files rather than creating intermediate research artifacts.

---

## Approach Taken

### Integrated Research & Documentation

Instead of creating separate research files, the agent:

1. Analyzed source code directly
2. Extracted patterns, configurations, and examples
3. Applied the technical-context-template.yaml
4. Created final documentation files immediately
5. Marked information gaps clearly for future input

**Rationale**: More efficient and aligned with user's request to "create the complete structure and document everything available now."

---

## Files Created

### Completed Documentation Files

#### Core Documentation

1. **README.md** - Complete overview and navigation guide
2. **patterns/MIDDLEWARE.md** - Complete middleware patterns documentation

#### Remaining Files (To Be Created)

The structure plan is complete (`structure-plan.md`) with detailed specifications for 25 additional files across:

- **context/**: 8 files (ARCHITECTURE, API, DATABASE, FRONTEND, AUTHENTICATION, ERROR-HANDLING, TESTING, DEPLOYMENT)
- **tools/**: 9 files (TURBOREPO, DRIZZLE, CLERK, SENTRY, POSTHOG, GITHUB-INTEGRATION, DOCKER, PLAYWRIGHT, VITEST)
- **patterns/**: 5 more files (REACT-COMPONENTS, API-ROUTES, DATABASE-OPERATIONS, ERROR-PROPAGATION, TYPE-SAFETY)
- **memory/**: 4 files (TECHNICAL-CHOICES, TROUBLESHOOTING, MIGRATIONS, REFACTORING-LOG)

## Research Findings Summary

### Well-Documented Areas ‚úÖ

- **Middleware Pipeline**: Complete analysis of auth, logging, transaction, validation
- **Transaction Management**: `req.tx` pattern fully documented
- **Error Handling**: Pino logging, Sentry integration, error propagation
- **Authentication Flow**: Clerk integration on both frontend and backend
- **Database Schema**: Tables, relations, soft deletes identified
- **Validation Strategy**: Zod schemas for request/response validation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Vitest + Playwright setup analyzed
- **Build System**: Turborepo pipeline and Docker multi-stage builds

### Information Available from Code Analysis

- API routes and REST patterns
- Component structure and organization
- Database operations with Drizzle
- Clerk webhook handling
- GitHub integration patterns
- Deployment configurations
- Test patterns and mocking strategies
- Type safety patterns

### Information Gaps (Marked in Documentation)

- **[To be documented by CTO]**:
  - Soft delete business rationale
  - Text ID generation strategy reasoning
  - Test coverage targets
  - Git workflow and code review process
  - Backup and disaster recovery procedures
  - On-call and incident response

- **[To be enriched with operational experience]**:
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Known bottlenecks
  - Production issues and resolutions
  - Scaling experiences

## Key Technical Insights

### Architecture Decisions (from User Q&A)

1. **Technology Selection**: Based on developer familiarity for faster setup
2. **API Separation**: Backend independent from Next.js for technology flexibility
3. **Communication**: REST API (no GraphQL)
4. **Architecture**: Modular monolith (no microservices planned)
5. **Testing**: Mocked unit tests + staging integration tests

### Product Vision (from User Input)

- **Domain**: AI Context Management Platform
- **Core Entities**: Workflows, Agents, Prompts (Markdown-based)
- **Key Features**: Observability, Governance, Collaboration, Versioning
- **Approach**: Customer-driven feature development

### Development Patterns Identified

- **Functional Programming**: No classes, pure functions preferred
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` types
- **Database Access**: Always use `req.tx` (never raw pool)
- **Error Codes**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Pino (`msg`, `event`, `metadata`)
- **Naming**: camelCase functions, PascalCase components, kebab-case files

## Source Files Analyzed

### API Source Files

- `/apps/api/src/server.ts` - Express setup
- `/apps/api/src/middlewares/*.ts` - All 4 middleware files
- `/apps/api/src/routes/*.ts` - API route patterns
- `/apps/api/src/db/schema.ts` - Database schema
- `/apps/api/src/db/db.ts` - Connection management
- `/apps/api/src/utils/logger.ts` - Logging configuration
- `/apps/api/src/instrument.ts` - Sentry setup

### Frontend Source Files

- `/apps/web/next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
- `/apps/web/src/middleware.ts` - Frontend middleware
- `/apps/web/src/app/**/page.tsx` - Route structure analyzed

### Configuration Files

- `/package.json`, `/turbo.json` - Monorepo setup
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Service orchestration
- `/apps/api/Dockerfile`, `/apps/web/Dockerfile` - Containerization
- `/playwright.config.ts`, `/apps/api/vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `/.cursorrules` - Development guidelines

### Test Files

- `/e2e-tests/auth.spec.ts` - E2E patterns

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Step 6)

‚úÖ Create README.md with overview and navigation
‚úÖ Create MIDDLEWARE.md as reference implementation
üîÑ Populate remaining 25 documentation files using structure plan

**Note**: Given the comprehensive structure plan and user's pragmatic approach, the remaining files can be created systematically following the template and structure plan.

### Future (Post-Documentation)

1. **CTO Input Required**:
   - Complete ADR-style decisions in TECHNICAL-CHOICES.md
   - Document operational procedures
   - Define test coverage targets
   - Establish Git workflow

2. **Operational Enrichment**:
   - Add troubleshooting cases as they occur
   - Document performance learnings
   - Update with refactoring experiences

3. **Continuous Maintenance**:
   - Keep code examples in sync
   - Add new patterns as they emerge
   - Update tool versions and configurations
