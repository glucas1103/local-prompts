# Task: Enrich Technical Context

## Objective

Interactive Q&A session with user to fill critical technical information gaps.

## Language Requirements

All generated content must be written in English.

## Inputs

- `.speiros/artifacts/audit-technical/audit-results.md`

## Steps

1. **Prepare questions**
   - Review gaps from audit results
   - Prioritize: technical decisions, architecture rationale, future plans
   - Group by domain for clarity

2. **Present gap analysis to user**
   - Show identified technical domains
   - Explain proposed structure
   - Get user confirmation/feedback

3. **Ask targeted questions** (elicit=true)
   - For each major gap:
     - "Why was [technology/framework] chosen over alternatives?"
     - "What are the key architectural decisions (ADRs)?"
     - "What are known technical debt areas?"
     - "What's the technical roadmap for [component]?"
     - "Are there performance/security considerations to document?"
   - Keep questions focused and specific
   - Allow "unknown" or "to research" answers

4. **Document responses**
   - Write to `.speiros/artifacts/audit-technical/enrichment-qa.md`
   - Structure:
     - Questions Asked (numbered)
     - User Responses (verbatim)
     - Key Technical Insights (extracted)
     - Remaining Gaps (what still needs research)

5. **Validate completeness**
   - Review with user: anything else to add?
   - Confirm: ready to proceed with structure creation

## Output

- `.speiros/artifacts/audit-technical/enrichment-qa.md`

## Success Criteria

- Critical technical decisions captured
- User validated technical domain structure
- Historical technical choices documented (ADR-style)
- Clear separation: answered vs. needs-research
