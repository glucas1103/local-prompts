## Example Refactoring Entries

### Refactoring: [Future Entry]
**Date**: [To be documented]  
**Status**: Planned

**Motivation**:  
[To be documented by CTO]

**Current Technical Debt**:
- [Areas identified for improvement]
- [Performance bottlenecks]
- [Code smells to address]

---

## Continuous Improvement Areas

**[To be documented by CTO]**:
- Which parts of the codebase need refactoring?
- What technical debt exists?
- What are the priorities?

### Potential Areas for Future Refactoring

Based on code analysis, potential areas to consider:

1. **Testing Coverage**
   - Expand unit test coverage
   - Add integration tests
   - Improve E2E test reliability

2. **Error Handling**
   - Standardize error responses
   - Improve error logging
   - Better error recovery

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database query optimization
   - Frontend bundle size
   - API response times

4. **Code Organization**
   - Extract reusable logic
   - Reduce code duplication
   - Improve module boundaries

## Refactoring Guidelines

When performing refactoring:

✅ **DO**:
- Write tests before refactoring
- Make small, incremental changes
- Document breaking changes
- Update related documentation
- Run full test suite
- Get code review

❌ **DON'T**:
- Mix refactoring with feature development
- Skip testing
- Make changes without documentation
- Refactor without understanding current behavior
